This [single-page app chess game](https://chess434.netlify.app) is live on
Netlify. It's logo is an image of IC 434, the Horsehead Nebula, that I took
using [iTelescope.net](https://www.itelescope.net/).

Building this app with a Next.js template was an opportunity for me to learn to
write pure functions. It was a major milestone in my learning journey, as
someone who has been dependent on the use of `for` loops and array mutations
since college! It's amazing to see how much you can get done with only `const`,
and once I got used to `Array.prototype`'s `map` and `filter` I think I actually
prefer them to `for` loops. Last but definitely not least with pure functions,
was learning to write recursion. Taking out pencil and paper and planning out
the function compostion necessary to get me from point A to point B was what
enabled me to finally write a working recursive function.

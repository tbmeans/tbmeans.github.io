In Python you can't modify a global variable within a function, but you can
call object methods that mutate a global object in a function, I think, and
I also wanting to confirm that it is a reference to an object that is stored
in a collection when you append an object to the collection, just like with
arrays. So I fired up the Python REPL...
		>>> from collections import deque
		>>> class Thang:
		...     def __init__(self):
		...             self.about = 'yo'
		...
		>>> listo = deque()
		>>> def fillr():
		...     th = Thang()
		...     listo.append(th)
		...     return
		...
		>>> fillr()
		>>> listo
		deque([<__main__.Thang object at 0x000001DA8A8A9D30>])
		>>> listo[0].about
		'yo'
